 *
 * WELCOME TO THE VOTING SYSTEM.
 * To run the voting system, the user must be in the correct directory:
 * ON TERMINAL: $ cd umn-csci-5801-s21-001/repo-Team001
 * On terminal -> change directory into Project1 and then into src:
 * ON TERMINAL: $ cd Project1
 *              $ cd src
 * Run the command: "make" ($ make) on terminal in the src directory.
 * Following this, run the command: "./main" ($ ./main).
 * You will be prompted with options to guide the user through it:
 * ">> help" will show the user how to load the election file in the system
 * which must be in the same directory - Project1/src/<your-file.csv>
 *
 * ">> load" will prompt the user to enter the election filename - <filename.csv>
 * 
 * After a valid file has been loaded, the system will ask the user if they want
 * to add a new election file to the election. The user can enter y (yes) or n (no).
 * If the user decides to enter a new file, the user will be prompted to enter the name
 * of a file. This action will continue until the user does not want to add a new file.
 * At that point, the system will perform the result of the election.
 *
 *
 * ">> quit" will exit out of the voting system.
 *
 * Run the command "make clean" - ($ make clean) on terminal to clean all
 * executable files and repeat the process to re-run the Voting System.
 *
 * To run the google tests the user must follow these steps:
  * ON TERMINAL: $ cd umn-csci-5801-s21-001/repo-Team001
 * On the terminal change directory to Project1 and then testing.
 * ON TERMINAL: $ cd Project1
 *              $ cd testing
 * Once in the testing directory you can run any of the test files:
 *
 * To run google tests use the following command:
 *
 * On TERMINAL: $ make
 *              $ ./testing

 * This will display the google unit tests on the terminal itself.  
 *
 * Thank you for choosing to run the Voting System.
